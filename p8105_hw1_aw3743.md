I’m an R Markdown document!

Problem 0.1

This .Rmd file is part of my GitHub repo for Homework 1. It renders to
github_document, and the repo is organized as instructed.

Problem 0.2

I will follow good coding style by: using clear variable names, writing
one command per line, adding whitespace for readability, and explaining
results in plain text.

# Problem 1: Exploring Early January Weather

We will first explore the ‘early_january_weather’ dataset.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
weather_df = early_january_weather
```

- The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.  
- The variables are: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid,
  wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.  
- The mean temperature is 39.58 °F.

\#I made a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x); color points using
humid variable & adding color inside of aes in my ggplot.

``` r
ggplot(weather_df, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature vs Time (colored by Humidity)",
    x = "Time (hourly)",
    y = "Temperature (F)",
    color = "Humidity"
  )
```

``` r
#  Display and save the plot to my project directory

 ggsave("temp_vs_humid.png", width = 6, height = 4)
```

# Problem 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
